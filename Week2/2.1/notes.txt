Ecmascript ---> tells us how js should look like ( provides specification for js compiler/engine , please follow all the things )

Javascript ---> scripting language corrsponding to Ecmascript but also provides external things like dom which is important 
for web development , setTimeout, fs.readFile 
Most famous js compiler/engine --> chrome v8 (C) , firefox --> spider monkey( c + rust)

Node js --> js is meant for browser. but smart people extract v8 part which is for js and add extra features (read from readFile) 
and make them suitable for backend ---> names node ( node js is a runtime ---> compiles a js )

Bun --> competiter of Nodejs ( Language ZIG )

Node js --> create cli , create a server , video player, game

HTTP --> protocol how website frontend connects with backend
frontend and    backend
(html css js)   (place where request goes --> server --> gives response)

http server --> authentication ( gpt4 ), some code that follows http

http (client side)-->
protocol --> http , https
address --> url/ip/port
route --> different route for different information/query
headers (authentication part cookie identification ) body ( what u ask/query ) params
method ( put, get, post)

protocol url             route

http ( server )-->
response header --> used for sign in purpose
response body  --> get the response back 
status codes --> signal 404, 200, 403 (authentication issue), 500 ( internal server)
